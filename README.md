Hotel reservation system


Here are the specifications given to us in the task brief.

Create a reservation system which books hotel rooms. It charges various rates for particular sections of the hotel. For example, hotels have penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.

Create the database to store the information related to the hotel.

Create a Swing frontend for..

    Registering the bookings
    Viewing the bookings
    Deleting a booking
    Creating a client
    Editing a client

Suites/rooms (102):

    Penthouse suite - 2 at €400/night
    Family suite - 20 at €180/night
    Double room - 50 at €120/night
    Twin room - 20 at €120/night
    Single room - 10 at €90/night

The user of the system should be able to view the number and type of rooms available for a given date, make, view and cancel bookings. The user should also be able to create and edit clients (customers) for the system.
